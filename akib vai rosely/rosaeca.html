                    <p>Rosacea is considered as a chronic, benign inflammatory skin condition that usually affects the face. If left untreated, the condition may worsens with time. Pink or red facial skin, small red bumps sometimes containing cysts and pus,
                        irritated eyes and small dilated blood vessels are the most common signs and symptoms of Rosacea.&nbsp;<br>The redness gradually spreads beyond the cheeks and nose to the chin and forehead. Sometimes the chest and ears become also
                        red. An individual having this kind of skin disorder just assume that he/she has very sensitive skin that flushes or blushes easily. The redness may cause permanent enlargement of small blood vessels of the face, as a result of
                        which they become more visible and appearing like telangiectasia’s (tiny red lines).&nbsp;<br>Continual episodes of blushing and flushing leads to inflammation, causing small papules or red bumps just like acne. Overgrowth of dermal
                        tissues is one of the most unpleasant aspects of rosacea, due to which phymatous change produce in the skin. This appears as permanent swelling and thickening of facial tissues. Rhinophyma (a bulbous nose) is an example of this
                        change.<br>WHAT CAUSES ROSACEA?<br>Scientists are still not sure about actual causes of rosacea. Its main cause is not clearly known, but it may be occurred due to environmental, or hereditary factors. By studying deeply, scientists
                        have found some important factors and clues that are thought to contribute in the disorder:<br>FACIAL BLOOD VESSEL ABNORMALITIES: Abnormalities in the facial blood vessels leads to persistent redness, flushing, and visible blood
                        vessels.<br>FAIR COMPLEXION: People with fair complexion have a much higher percentage of developing the disorder.<br>A MICROSCOPIC MITE (Demodex folliculorum):&nbsp; Demodex folliculorum is a tiny insect, that lives on everyone’s
                        skin usually on the cheeks, and the nose and, it is not harmful. However, it is considered that rosacea patients possess higher number of these mites than others. But it is still unclear whether rosacea is caused by mites or it
                        spreads the population of mites.<br><br><br>H. pylori BACTERIUM: H. pylori, a bacterium usually presents in the gut, responsible to stimulate bradykinin production, which is known to cause the dilation of blood vessels. Some scientists
                        suggested that the bacterium plays an important role in development of rosacea.&nbsp;<br>FAMILY HISTORY (INHERITANCE, GENES): It might be possible that individual having rosacea inherit genes from their parents or closed relatives.<br>Rosacea
                        may be aggravated by some other factors including:<br>&nbsp;<br>Humidity, sunlight or wind<br>Cosmetics<br>Vigorous exercise<br>Hot drinks and foods<br>Spicy foods, caffeine or dairy products<br>High temperatures<br>Alcohol consumption<br>Anxiety,

                        useful in improving the symptoms of rosacea by applying once or twice a day.<br>ORAL ANTIBIOTICS: Patients suffering from moderate rosacea are usually prescribed with oral antibiotic medications, that are useful in reducing inflammation.
                        The most common oral antibiotics are:Tetracycline (Sumycin),<br>&nbsp;doxycycline (Vibramycin, Oracea, Adoxa, Atridox),&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;minocycline (Dynacin, Minocin),<br>Doxycycline<br>ISOTRETINOIN(ACCUTANE): Isotretinoin is only
                        prescribed for resistant and severe rosacea.&nbsp; It is an acne drug that is used to treat acne vulgaris (common acne).<br>OTHER TREATMENTS:<br>LASER AND INTENSE LIGHT TREATMENT: Majority of patients are now turning towards intense
                        and laser light therapies to treat redness and inflammation on the neck, chest and face. Intense and laser pulse light therapy also help to improve complexion and skin. Sometimes the treatment can cause crusting of skin, bruising,
