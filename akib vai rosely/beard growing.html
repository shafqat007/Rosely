                    remedies don’t work well so, you can attempt various medical products and techniques. According to medical point of view, some best products for facial hair growth and development are:<br>ROGAINE:<br>Minoxidil is one of the components
                    of Rogaine that helps to enhance beard growth. This is usually sold without any prescription and, it Is the first choice of every man, when it comes to facial hair growth.<br>BIOTOPIC HEALTHY BEARD GROWTH SERUM:<br>This is the most

                    medical products and treatments are not helping to grow your beard, so you can also switch towards therapies:<br> DERMAROLLING THERAPY:&nbsp;<br>Derma rolling therapy also called Micro-neeedling therapy is a process in which tiny
                    needles are taken and roll on your face to enhance collagen production and improves blood circulation so that hormone rich blood easily rushes to the area of beard.<br> TESTOSTERONE THERAPY:<br>Testosterone, a male sex hormone also
                    responsible for patchy beard. In testosterone therapy, testosterone injections are given to enhance your hormone levels which results in thick facial growth hairs.<br>SOME TIPS TO ENHANCE YOUR BEARD:<br> TAKE CARE OF YOUR SKIN: Wash
                    and clean your face regularly because it will exfoliate the skin, stimulate circulation and open up your pores.<br> REDUCING STRESS: Whenever you are in stress, your cortisol level becomes high and these high cortisol levels have
                    a negative impact on development of testosterone as we discuss above low testosterone levels are responsible for patchy beard.&nbsp;<br>blood vessels are also constricted by stress as a result of which nutrients cannot reach to the
                    hair follicles. So try to avoid stress in your daily life.<br> IMPROVE YOUR DIET: You should take vitamin-rich and protein-rich diet because your body needs a healthy diet to stay healthy. Hair is a protein filament so, the more the
                    protein rich diet you will consume, the thicker your beard will look.&nbsp;<br><br>Foods like nuts, kale and eggs are very essential and must be incorporated into your diet because they will increase the production of testosterone
                    and give a luxurious appearance to your beard.<br> TRIM YOUR BEARD PROPERLY: Trim your beard after growing to a certain point. Trimming your beard at least one time in a week will help in getting rid of split hair ends and grow your
                    beardthicker &amp;amp; longer.<br> STAY HYDRATED: Drinking enough water makes your skin hydrated, and healthier skin means thicker beard.<br> USE THE RIGHT TOOLS: Use comb and scissors for shaping full beard but, if you only want
                    to shape your edges, electric trimmer is the best choic<br></p>
